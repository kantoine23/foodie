        <p><em>Hi! My name is Kamiko & I was born and raised in Queens, NY. Food has always been something
            that has always felt like home to me. My grandmother emigrated from Jamaica, & I had the honor of
            growing up & watching her really finesse these amazing caribbean dishes. It was honestly amazing to see what she can do in the kitchen with just a few ingredients.
            Athough my food experience was limited to mainly west indian food, as I got older and was able to venture out, I was able to explore so many different kinds of
            cultures and foods that just absolutley blew my mind. Eating is something I think pretty much everyone loves to do. But for me, it's the experience behind the
            meal that really resonates with me. Once I moved into my very first box of an apartment, I really began to get into the groove of cooking. I found something that
            I loved doing as much as I loved eating: cooking. Who would've thought right? With the knowledge that I was able to attain throughout the years of eating my way
            through NYC, it allowed me to keep an open mind when it comes to trying different cusines. I started cooking pretty much anything I craved. If I saw something on
            TV that I thought looked good, I would begin trying to figure out how to replicate that meal, and with that, cooking slowly became an outlet for me. I started Thefoodiewhowearsprada
            to share all my food related experiences with the world. From recipes, to my journey around the world trying different cusines from different cultures.
            Food is universal! I find beauty & solace in that.</em></p>
